# Programming Language Design Workshop

A hands-on course exploring programming language design concepts using Python's modern features. This course leverages Python's type system and structural pattern matching to demonstrate key programming language concepts and implementations.

## Course Overview

This workshop consists of 10 lectures (2 hours each) that combine theoretical foundations with practical implementations. Students will learn about programming language design principles while getting hands-on experience with Python's advanced features.

## Course Structure

### Lecture 1: Introduction to Programming Language Design
- What is a programming language?
- The importance of programming language design
- The course structure and expectations
- Python as a language for exploring language design concepts

### Lecture 2: Types and Structural Pattern Matching in Python
- Introduction to Python's type system
- Type hints and type checking
- Structural pattern matching (match/case statements)
- Practical applications and examples

### Lecture 3: Programming Language Implementation: A mini interpreter
- Parsing and lexical analysis
- Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Program semantics

### Lecture 3: TBA

### Lecture 4: TBA

### Lecture 5: TBA

### Lecture 6: TBA

### Lecture 7: TBA

### Lecture 8: TBA

### Lecture 9: TBA

### Lecture 10: TBA

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher (for pattern matching support)
- Basic Python programming knowledge
